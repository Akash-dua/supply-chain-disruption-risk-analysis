Supply chain disruption forecasting and risk simulation
Problem Statement
Global supply chains operating in Just-In-Time environments are highly vulnerable to shipment delays, supplier unreliability, and transportation disruptions.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning
- Risk Scoring
- What-if Analysis
- Visualization

## What Was Done
- Developed a delay forecasting and risk scoring model to evaluate supplier reliability
- Designed what-if scenarios to assess transportation and global disruption risks
- Modeled the financial impact of production delays

## Key Insights
- A small number of high-risk suppliers contribute to the majority of delay-related costs
- Sea-based transport shows higher disruption risk compared to road and air
- Early identification of high-risk suppliers enables proactive mitigation

## Business Value
Supports proactive supplier monitoring, risk mitigation, and operational decision-making in global supply chains.
